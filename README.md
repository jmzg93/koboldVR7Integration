## Tested Robot
- **Kobold VR7**

## Description

This integration allows Home Assistant users to control and monitor their Kobold vacuum robots via the official Kobold API (version 2). It includes support for advanced features like:
- Real-time robot status updates via WebSocket.
- Start, pause, stop, and return-to-base commands.
- Monitoring battery status, errors, and available commands.
- Zone-specific and map-specific cleaning (only show maps with name).

### ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**
- As this is my first integration and my first time using Python, the code might not be the most efficient or well-structured. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated!

## Features

- **Basic Control**:
  - Start, stop, and pause cleaning.
  - Send the robot back to its base.
  - Locate the robot.
  - Adjust fan speed with modes (`auto`, `eco`, `turbo`).
- **Zone and Map Cleaning**:
  - Start cleaning specific zones or entire maps.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Robot state (cleaning, docked, idle, etc.).
  - Battery level.
  - Charging status.
  - Error reporting.
  - Real-time updates via WebSocket.

## Prerequisites

- An active Kobold account.
- At least one Kobold vacuum robot configured via the official Kobold app.
- A running Home Assistant instance.

## Installation

### Installation via HACS

1. Ensure you have [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) installed in your Home Assistant instance.
2. Go to **HACS > Integrations**.
3. Click on the three dots menu in the top right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
4. Add the repository URL `https://github.com/jmzg93/koboldHAIntegration` and select the category **Integration**.
5. Click **Add**.
6. The Kobold VR7 integration should now appear in the list of available integrations. Click **Install**.
7. Restart Home Assistant.

### Manual Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the folder `custom_components/kobold_vr7` into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant installation.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

### Configuration

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Integrations** in Home Assistant.
2. Click **Add Integration** and search for **Kobold**.
3. Enter your email and the OTP code sent to the email associated with your robot.

## Services

The Kobold integration includes the following custom services:

### **`kobold_vr7.clean_zone`**

Starts cleaning one or multiple specific zones (must be from the same map).

- **Parameters**:
  - `zones_uuid` (required): The UUID of the zone(s) to clean. Multiple zones can be specified using comma separation (e.g., `"zone123456789,zone987654321"`).

### **`kobold_vr7.clean_map`**

Starts cleaning an entire map.

- **Parameters**:
  - `map_uuid` (required): The UUID of the map to clean.

---

## Usage

Once the integration is set up, entities corresponding to your Kobold robots will be added. You can interact with them via the Home Assistant dashboard or automations.

### Additional Documentation

- [Lovelace dashboard example](docs/lovelace-dashboard-example.md) â€“ replicate the sample subview, automations, scripts, sensors, and helpers used to control the Kobold VR7 from Home Assistant.

> **Note:** The examples reference the `vacuum.roomba` entity. Replace it with the entity exposed by your own Kobold robot before applying the configurations.

### Supported Features

- **Robot Control**:
  - `vacuum.start`: Starts cleaning.
  - `vacuum.pause`: Pauses cleaning.
  - `vacuum.stop`: Stops cleaning.
  - `vacuum.return_to_base`: Sends the robot to its base.
  - `vacuum.locate`: Finds the robot.
- **Custom Services**:
  - `kobold_vr7.clean_zone`: Cleans a specific zone.
  - `kobold_vr7.clean_map`: Cleans an entire map.

## Entity Attributes

The integration provides detailed attributes for your robot entities:

| Attribute            | Description                                  |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `state`             | Current state of the robot (`cleaning`, `idle`, `docked`, etc.). |
| `battery_level`     | Robot's battery level as a percentage.       |
| `is_charging`       | Indicates if the robot is charging.          |
| `errors`            | List of current errors (if any).             |
| `available_commands`| Commands currently available for the robot.  |
| `maps`              | List of available floorplans.                |
| `zones`             | Detailed information about zones in each map.|
| `fan_speed`         | Current fan speed mode (`auto`, `eco`, `turbo`). |
| `bag_status`        | Status of the vacuum's bag/container.        |

## Troubleshooting

If the integration fails to load, ensure that:

1. You have placed the `kobold_vr7` folder in the correct `custom_components` directory.
2. You have restarted Home Assistant after installing the integration.
3. Your Home Assistant instance has access to the internet for API calls.
4. Your Kobold account is active and the robot is properly set up in the official app.

Check the logs in **Settings > System > Logs** for detailed error messages. You can increase the logging level for this integration by adding the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.kobold_vr7: debug
```

### Known Issues

If you see warnings in your logs about blocking SSL operations or entity service schemas, make sure you're using version 2.0.1 or later of this integration which addresses these Home Assistant compatibility issues.

#### System-Specific Notes
- On Raspberry Pi systems, some users may experience SSL-related warnings in the logs. Version 2.0.2 addresses these issues with an improved SSL context handling.
- If you encounter WebSocket connection issues, try increasing your network timeout settings or check if your network is blocking WebSocket connections.

## Multilingual Support

Starting from version 2.0.2, this integration supports multiple languages:
- English
- Spanish
- German

The language is automatically selected based on your Home Assistant locale settings.
